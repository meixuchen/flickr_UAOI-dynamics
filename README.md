# Using Python to download and process Flickr photos

This repository contains the code and sample data for the paper 'Understanding the dynamics of urban areas of interest through volunteered geographic information'. Three code files provide detailed tutorials: 
* how to download Flickr photos,
* how to identify and delineate urban areas of interest, 
* how to profile the spatiotemporal characteristics of these areas.
